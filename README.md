# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
**Assignment Jupyter Notebook URL Address:** https://github.com/zaboush/Model_5_Assignment_5p1/blob/main/prompt.ipynb
## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to use what we have learnt over the past few weeks about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not. 
There are five different types of coupons: Less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).
## Data Description
The provided data came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which was originally collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. 
There are three possible answers people can choose from:
“Right away”
“Later, before the coupon expires”
“No, I do not want the coupon”
The first two responses are labeled as “Y = 1,” and the third is labeled as “Y = 0”.
